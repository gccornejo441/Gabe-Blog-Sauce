# How to Host Your Static Website on Amazon S3

Scroll to the bottom if you would like to watch the walkthrough.

Amazon S3 is a great option for hosting static sites. This guide provides a quick step-by-step process to get your static website up and running on S3.

## Steps to Host Your Site on Amazon S3

1. **Log into AWS**  
   Open the Amazon S3 dashboard in your AWS Management Console.

2. **Create Bucket**  
   Click “Create bucket”. Name your bucket `runmore-test-site`. Ensure 'Block all public access' is disabled to make your website publicly accessible.

3. **Go Into Your Bucket**  
   Navigate to your newly created `runmore-test-site` bucket.

4. **Upload Content**  
   Drag and drop your website files (like `index.html`) into the bucket or use the "Add files" option.

5. **Open Permissions Tab**  
   Go to the “Permissions” tab in your bucket settings.

6. **Edit Bucket Policy**  
   Click on “Bucket policy” and add the following policy to allow public access:

 ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::runmore-test-site/*"
           }
       ]
   }
```
7. **Vist Your Site**
    Use the bucket’s public URL to access your site. This URL can be found in the bucket properties under “Static website hosting”.

    Your static website will now be live on Amazon S3. This setup provides a cost-effective solution for hosting websites that do not require server-side code.
