## ASP.NET Core Identity in Blazor

ASP.NET Core Identity is a powerful framework for managing user authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core applications. However, when it comes to Blazor app client-server communication, there is a distinction to be made. Blazor apps typically follow a different client-server communication model, which means that ASP.NET Core Identity's design, centered around HTTP request and response communication, doesn't align perfectly with Blazor.

## User Interface for ASP.NET Core Identity in Blazor

When building Blazor apps that utilize ASP.NET Core Identity for user management, it's recommended to use Razor Pages instead of Razor components for Identity-related user interface (UI) elements. This includes functionalities such as user registration, login, logout, and other user management tasks. Razor Pages provide a better fit for rendering these UI elements in the context of ASP.NET Core Identity.

## Authorization in Blazor

Once authentication is established, applying authorization rules becomes essential to control what actions a user can perform within the application. Blazor offers both role-based and policy-based authorization mechanisms.

### Role-based Authorization

Role-based authorization allows you to restrict access to certain parts of your application based on predefined roles. Using the `AuthorizeView` component, you can specify the required roles for accessing specific content. For example, the following code snippet requires the user to have either an "Admin" or "Superuser" role claim to view the enclosed content:

```
<AuthorizeView Roles="Admin, Superuser">
    <p>You have an 'Admin' or 'Superuser' role claim.</p>
</AuthorizeView>
```

By leveraging the `AuthorizeView` component, you can easily define the necessary role-based authorization rules in your Blazor app.

### Policy-Based Authorization

Policy-based authorization provides more granular control over access permissions by defining custom policies that users must satisfy. With the `AuthorizeView` component, you can enforce policy-based authorization rules. For instance, the following code snippet requires the user to satisfy both the "Over21" and "LivesInCalifornia" policies to access the enclosed content:

```
<AuthorizeView Policy="Over21">
    <AuthorizeView Policy="LivesInCalifornia">
        <p>You satisfy the 'Over21' and 'LivesInCalifornia' policies.</p>
    </AuthorizeView>
</AuthorizeView>
```

By combining policies, you can create complex authorization rules that precisely reflect your application's requirements.

### Content during Authentication

During the authentication process, you may want to display specific content while the authentication is still in progress. The `AuthorizeView` component provides the `Authorizing` section, which allows you to show content exclusively during authentication. Here's an example:

```
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <p>Hello, @context.User.Identity?.Name!</p>
    </Authorized>
    <Authorizing>
        <p>You can only see this content while authentication is in progress.</p>
    </Authorizing>
</AuthorizeView>
```

This way, you can provide a seamless user experience by displaying relevant information depending on the authentication status.

## Resource Authorization and Procedural Logic

Blazor also offers additional features for resource authorization and incorporating authorization rules into procedural logic.

### AuthorizeRouteView

When you need to authorize users for specific resources, you can utilize the `AuthorizeRouteView` component. By passing the request's route data to the `Resource` parameter of `AuthorizeRouteView`, you can control access to resources based on the route. Here's an example usage:

```
<AuthorizeRouteView Resource="@routeData" RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
```

This approach enables fine-grained authorization for different parts of your Blazor app.

### Procedural Logic

If you expect to check authorization rules as part of procedural logic, Blazor provides the `cascade` parameter of type `Task<AuthenticationState>`. You can use this parameter to obtain the user's `ClaimsPrincipal` and perform custom authorization checks. Additionally, you can combine `Task<AuthenticationState>` with other services, such as `IAuthorizationService`, to execute code based on specific authorization policies.

For example:

```
(await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, "content-editor")).Succeeded
```

By leveraging procedural logic and utilizing the available services, you can implement complex authorization workflows tailored to your application's needs.

## Dive Deeper

This blog post provides a brief overview of Blazor security and identity. For a more comprehensive understanding and detailed guidance, it's recommended to refer to the [MS Blazor Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio#scaffold-identity-into-a-blazor-server-project). There, you'll find in-depth resources and tutorials that cover various aspects of security and identity management in Blazor.

Remember, building secure and user-friendly applications is essential for success. With ASP.NET Core Identity and Blazor's authorization mechanisms, you can create robust and protected web applications that meet the highest standards of security.
